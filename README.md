### Hello coder friend 👋

I'm Ricardo from Spain and I do Web development 👨‍💻. I consider myself as a JavaScript friki ❤. I really enjoy learning languages, libraries and frameworks for web development like:

* ⚛ React
* 💻 Vuejs 
* 📱 React Native


I also enjoy making web services with nodejs.

I love to teach and help people to learn programming and JavaScript. You can checkout out my [YouTube channel 🎞](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRV9aKTbMTVNTsYRt-jg6gQ) and [Instagram account 🤳](https://www.instagram.com/rricardo.coder/)
